This project is for the Winterterm 2025/2026 course Seminar Modern Programming Languages at Ruhr-University Bochum.

In this seminar I'm studying the basics of the shading language HLSL, where the focus is on the graphics pipeline, the different shader types and variable types.
I'm making this application to understand the graphics pipeline and the different shader types and to learn the Direct3D11 API.
